AI-Based Customer Complaint Impact & Resolution
 Predictor
1. Project Vision
An AI-powered system to intelligently prioritize, predict, and assist in resolving customer complaints
using NLP, ML, MCP, and PostgreSQL.
2. User Personas
Customers submit complaints. Support Agents resolve them using AI assistance. Admins monitor
SLA, analytics, and system performance.
3. User Journey
Complaint submission → AI severity & priority prediction → MCP-assisted resolution → Human
approval → Feedback loop.
4. Core Pages
Landing Page, Login/Register, Complaint Submission, Complaint Status, Agent Dashboard,
Complaint Detail View, Analytics Dashboard.
5. AI Capabilities
Severity classification, resolution time prediction, priority scoring, SHAP explainability.
6. MCP Integration
MCP acts as an AI co-pilot suggesting resolution steps, fetching policies, drafting responses, and
assisting agents with human-in-the-loop control.
7. PostgreSQL Usage
PostgreSQL stores users, complaints, AI predictions, MCP-assisted resolutions, and feedback
ensuring auditability and reliability.
8. Database Tables

Users, Complaints, AI_Predictions, Resolutions, Resolution_Feedback.
9. Backend Architecture
Django + DRF backend with controlled MCP tools accessing PostgreSQL and AI services.
10. Tech Stack
Frontend: React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS | Backend: Django, DRF | DB: PostgreSQL | AI: Python,
SHAP, MCP
11. Why This Project Stands Out
Combines predictive AI, generative AI, explainability, human-in-the-loop design, and
enterprise-grade architecture.
